Put that on top of their 99.99% uptime guarantee covered by their Service Level Agreement and you should be covered for both personal and business needs.",

Unfortunately we don’t know the details on the hardware in the servers, but I’m pretty sure someone from Mean Servers is willing to provide an insight into this when requested.
